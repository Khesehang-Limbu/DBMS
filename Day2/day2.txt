File Processing Systems (Traditional file system) - if physical format of the file is changed the program has also to be changed
-> Each application has data files related to containing all the data records needed by application
-> SUch system stores data in .txt file format or .dat or .doc file format, It stores data in a single line (i.e. line by line), with fixed delimiters as whitespaces, comma, tabs, or other special characters

Integrity, in the context of computer systems, refers to methods of ensuring that data is real, accurate and safeguarded from unauthorized user modification.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Limitations:
- Data redundancy and inconsistency (redundancy is like repitition)
- Data accessing is difficult
- Data Isolation (At a time only one person can work)
- Integrity Problems (one is combine and another is reliable, combining is diffuclt)
- Atomicity Problems (Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability => Data goes at once or not, consistent, Durability -> even if system fails, data remains)
- Concurrent-access anomalies
- Security problems (No authorization facility)
- Wastage of Labor and Space (Requires more space)

In DBMS, data is stored in file, but in RDBMS, in tabular form

------------------------------____-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages:
- Quick and easy to set up and use
- Easy to understand
- Easy to implement
- Less hardware and software requirements
- Less initial investment
- Less skills required to handle flat database systems
- Less overhead
- Best for small business

Purpose of DBMS:-
- To reduce redundancy
- To avoid inconsistency (Customer address)
- TO share data
- TO provide support for transactions
- To maintain integrity (Studnet roll number in different filed)
- To enfore Security
- To provide efficient backup and recovery
- TO concurrent access database

Disadvantages of DBMS
- Problem associated twith centralization
- INcreased costs
- Maintaining intricacy (complexity)
- Frequent upgrade/replacement cycles
- Complextiy of backup and recovery

Database users are categorized in five groups:
- Native User (A user who uses a database)
- Application programmers (Programmers who use database in their backend)
- Sophisticated Users (Engineers, Doctors, Pilot, field-specialists who use SQL Query)
- Specialized Users (Computer Aided Design, expert system, knowledge base (specific field ))
- Stand-alone Users (Only one database, not linked with other databases)
