Entity Relationship Model
- Relationship are created by dividing object of interest into entity and its characteristics into attributes
- Different entities are related using relationships

Relatinal Model:
- Data is organized in two dimensional tables
- one field is common in two tables, realtionships managed using primary and foreign key.
- Tables are known as relations in realtional model
- information related to a particular type is stored in rows of table 

Object Oriented Model:
- Extended form of ER model with Object Oriented data model
- Data is stored in the form of objects, classes, and inheritance
- It represents real world objets, attributes, and behaviors.
- It provides clear modular structure and easy to maintain and modify the existing code.
- Class is entity (attributes and behaviors)

- Objets: The real world entities and situations are represented as objects
- Objects have three properites i.e. state, behavior, and identity

Object Relational Data Model:
- It is the combination of Object Oriented Database MOdel and Relational Databse Model
- All data are in the form of tables
- It supports objects, classes, inheritance, etc and also data types, tabular structure like Realtioal.
- It's goal is to close the gap between OOM and Relational

Advantages:
- Extensibility
- Inheritance
- Complex Data Type

Disadvantage:
- Since object and relationships both work together, there may arise errors
